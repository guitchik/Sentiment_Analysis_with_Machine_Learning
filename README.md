# Building a High-Performing Stock Portfolio with Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis



##### Group Members: Ram Gollakota, Celeste Terell, Taylor Little and Timothy Prost



## Motivation and Summary

We will create a portfolio of 5 stocks based on stocks identified through sentiment analysis. We will assume an investment of $100,000. We will use machine learning algorithms to discover the best trading strategy for the portfolio. Some may be buy and some sell. We will start with a seed of $100,000 and provide our return on investment based on the algorithmic trading model.

## Sourcing Data

Part 1. Use sentiment analysis to identify 5 stocks. [ if we are not able to make progress we will assume these 5 stocks: APPL, BO, BAC. T, GM

Part 2. Source data from Alpaca API and create dataframe with 4-5 year data



## Data Cleanup & Model Training

Part 3.  Clean data, generate SMA Values. 

Part 4. Scale data using StandardScaler

part 5. Split to Train and Test data





## Model Evaluation

A. Baseline Algorithm:  Start with SVM Model. Get classification matrix. Create Prediction Graph.

B. Adjust baseline with different mix of train and test data. 

C. Evaluate AdaBoost algorithm. Get classification matrix. Create prediction graph.

D. Evaluate LogisticRegression algorithm. Get classificant matrix. Create prediction graph.

E. Evaluate XGBoost available on SageMaker to repeat above steps.





## Discussion

Compare the results from different models.
